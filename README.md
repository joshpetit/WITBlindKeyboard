# When I Type Blind Keyboard
WIT Blind Keyboard is an application in its beginning stages aimed at making it easier for people with visual
disabilities to type on computers.

## How it works
It first starts with a prompt asking the user to place their hands on the keyboard and press down
the ten keys they would like to use for the program. Based on the order those ten keys are pressed different
characters are outputted to a textbox.
